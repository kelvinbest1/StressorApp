# README

# Stressor App
This project is designed to help track a user's stressors

# Installation
Add this to a new folder:

# Fork & Clone
cd into that folder
Run Bundle Install
Run rails s (server) within the backend folder
Open the index.html within the frontend folder
Usage
When the user opens the html file, they are greeted with a login. After a user enters their name, their stressors overcamed or not will show up. The user will be prompted to enter a stressor. Once they have, the stressor will appear and they will get 2 buttons by the stressor (overcamed and delete). If they user clicks "overcamed", the stressor will update to completed and strike through the text. This will persist between multiple logins. If the user clicks "delete" the stressor will be deleted.
